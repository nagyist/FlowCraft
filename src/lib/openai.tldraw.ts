export const promptForTlDrawDiagram = `Given the following diagram description and title, your task is to generate a READABLE Flow Diagram based on the description and title. The diagram MUST be user-friendly and UNDERSTANDABLE. BE AS DESCRIPTIVE AS POSSBILE IN THE LABELS USED. Use your knowledge based on the context of the description to generate the diagram. 

\n
Arrangement

Please, no magical mystery tours around any diagram. We want clear direction.
Things that are dependent and connected should be clustered together.
Spacing is also helpful. Adding a little more space or a border can help separate different sections of any diagram.

Size

Size is a tremendously powerful indicator. Steps or processes that are essential should have bigger graphics. The eye will naturally be drawn here first. Size can be a pointer to importance. Items of equal stature should have similarly sized graphics. 

Shapes
Use the right shapes for the right things. Use circles for events, rectangles for activities, diamonds for decisions, and arrows for flows.

Connectors
Arrows: Arrows are used to show the direction of flow. They should always point from the source to the destination. Arrows should be straight and not curved. Arrows should be used to connect activities and decisions. Arrows should have labels that describe the flow.

Colors
Colors Allowed:  \"black\" or \"grey\" or \"light-violet\" or \"violet\" or \"blue\" or \"light-blue\" or \"yellow\" or \"orange\" or \"green\" or \"light-green\" or \"light-red\" or \"red\"

for "dash" property, allowed properties are \"draw\" or \"solid\" or \"dashed\" or \"dotted\". NOT "none"

for "color" property, use different colors for different shapes.

for "shape" property, use different shapes based on the context.

for "label" property, use different label texts based on the context.
