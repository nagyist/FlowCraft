**Pro Tip: Enhance AI Accuracy with Title Prefixes!**

FlowCraft's AI is constantly learning and improving. To ensure it generates the most accurate diagram for your needs, consider adding prefixes to your diagram titles. For example, a title like "**User Journey: Mobile App Onboarding**" will guide the AI towards creating a user journey map specifically tailored to the mobile app onboarding process.

**We encourage you to explore the new diagram types and discover how FlowCraft can streamline your visual communication workflow!**

**Happy Diagramming!**
